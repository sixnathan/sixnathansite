Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place to share my thoughts, projects, and things I've learned. Writing helps me think more clearly and hopefully it'll be useful to others too.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Projects** I'm working on
- **Things I've learned** - technical and otherwise
- **Thoughts** on various topics

## A Code Example

Here's some code to show that syntax highlighting works:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

Thanks for reading!
