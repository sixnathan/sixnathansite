if you could ask the most intelligent, most knowledgable person in the world any number of questions youd like, would you even bother to try answer those questions yourself?

for me, at least, this question is surprisingly difficult to answer. the only response i might have is: how do we know what questions to ask?

this is the big limitation, and thankfully it does inspire hope that learning and the domain-specific skills that have been built up until now still hold value. without knowing anything about a topic, it becomes surprisingly difficult to find questions that lead to answers which matter.

thats why, even though the projects im building at the moment could be trivially created by artificial intelligence, knowledge will enable me to ask questions that best point the efforts of the machine (and i) in the right directions.

garry kasparov coined the term centaur chess. he considered the idea that the peak of skill in chess could be reached only when man and machine combined and worked together to make decisions.

this turned out to be false. chess algorithms such as deep blue, and eventually stockfish, completely outperformed even the best humans, and did not improve even with their help. praise for human skill in chess now has the caveat 'for a human'.



i hope we are not centaurs
